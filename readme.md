#We Build SG

Who are we? We are **technies** - developers, designers, programmers, hackers or makers.

- **veteran techies** to get introduced to the community of open events and open source
- **wannabe techies** to get examples of great open source projects and  events to meet mentors
- **traveling techies** to drop by and connect with the local ones
- **existing techies** to keep connecting, mentoring and growing the open community

**Open Events** are *free tech events* that are open for public and anyone can drop by! Listed events are within the _next 2 months_.

**Open Source** are projects with [free licenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licences) that [grants recipients extensive rights to modify and redistribute, which would otherwise be prohibited by copyright law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_license).
