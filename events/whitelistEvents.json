    "name": "Sensorium 360° Parallel Programme: Listening to the Universe by Honor Harger",
    "description": "In this talk, Honor Harger will explore the sounds of the sky, using art to connect her audience to the universe.  Sound waves cannot propagate in the vacuum of space, and the stars and planets are not directly audible.  However, radio waves emitted from celestial bodies can be turned into sound by ordinary radio receivers’ speakers that convert electrical signals into sound waves. Using this century-old process, the universe becomes 'soundful' -- this is all possible due to the science of radio astronomy.  This talk will show us how radio enables us to hear something which is physically present, but imperceptible to our senses.",

    "description": "We are having another hack night!  This time my crushing insecurity about the code i've written (ok, not really true -- James) makes we want to have other eyes look at it and help me improve (this is true though). What this actually is: Code Reviews & pair programming.  If you're working on something and want some feedback, come down.  If you're looking to learn, come down and see how everyone else codes.  If you've got something to work on, come down and work with people! Why? We realise that the best way to gain mastery of a craft is to see how the more experienced hands does things. Watching and learning the best practices, habits and even the keyboard shortcuts of others are the quickest way to level up and become better at our craft. My co-hosts and myself are rather passionate about good community, and constructive feedback in hacking culture.  We want to help build this in the community at large.  Come be part of that.",
