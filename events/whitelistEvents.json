    "description": "Maybe it’s a sensor that analyses air quality at your location, or tracks noise level in your neighborhood, or maybe you’re just looking for a solution to get your IoT devices talking. Come and meet like-minded individuals and build together on the Snootlab Akeru Beta 3.2 – An Arduino platform that uses the Sigfox IoT technology to send small amounts of data via its own proprietary network back to the cloud. This technology is used by companies like FastPark and Whistle. If you have some basic knowledge of Arduino, this workshop is for you! Else, just join us to learn more! Just bring your own laptops with the Arduino IDE, and Arduino-based sensors. SingTel will be providing the Snootlab Akeru Beta 3.2 boards, and 12Geeks will also have some sensors available for purchase on-site. ",
