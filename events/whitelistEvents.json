The innovation team at SingTel is testing a new low power, long range network that will let you run IoT devices anywhere, with many months of battery life. Weâ€™re looking for cool new sensors and gadgets for this new network, and we welcome your participation! Think of the possibilities: wearables that track your health and location, flood and pollution sensors, even sensors for dengue and rats! Check out the Arduino kit that we will be providing to connect your IoT device to the new network. http://snootlab.com/lang-en/snootlab-shields/547-akeru-beta-32-en.html",
