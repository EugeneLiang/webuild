    "description": "In this talk, Honor Harger will explore the sounds of the sky, using art to connect her audience to the universe.  Sound waves cannot propagate in the vacuum of space, and the stars and planets are not directly audible.  However, radio waves emitted from celestial bodies can be turned into sound by ordinary radio receivers’ speakers that convert electrical signals into sound waves. Using this century-old process, the universe becomes 'soundful' -- this is all possible due to the science of radio astronomy.  This talk will show us how radio enables us to hear something which is physically present, but imperceptible to our senses.",
